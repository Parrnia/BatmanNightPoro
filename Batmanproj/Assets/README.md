Summary of Work Done
In this project, a Cyberpunk-themed interactive scene was implemented featuring Batmobile movement, multiple gameplay states (Normal, Stealth, and Alert), a controllable Bat-Signal, and visual and audio alert effects.

Both 3D and UI-based animated backgrounds were created, and the entire system was implemented using modular, well-documented C# scripts suitable for further development and academic submission.
